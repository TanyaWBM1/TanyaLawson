        <strong>I reduce friction before increasing speed.</strong>
        <p>I help teams operate with clarity — fewer dropped balls, fewer misunderstandings, and less “where are we on this?” energy. Calm, consistent progress over chaos.</p>

        <strong>When outcomes matter and communication needs to stay clean.</strong>
        <p>I’m a strong fit for leaders and teams who want reliable execution, cleaner workflows, and someone who can handle complexity without noise. If your environment is fast-moving, high-stakes, or overloaded with handoffs, I bring calm structure and consistent follow-through.</p>

        <div class="eyebrow">Not a fit</div>
        <strong>When the culture rewards chaos.</strong>
        <p>If “urgency theater” is the norm and communication is consistently unclear, I’m probably not your best match — and that’s okay.</p>

      <article class="card span-8">
        <div class="eyebrow">AI era, done responsibly</div>
        <strong>I use modern tools to reduce friction — not replace judgment.</strong>
        <p>The goal is faster clarity, cleaner documentation, and smoother execution. I care about accuracy, privacy, and ethical use — no reckless automation.</p>
